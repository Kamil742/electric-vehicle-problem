  Super Wheels Company sells it's electric 2 wheelers based on the following pattern to it's retail and corporate customers. 
  Every month it starts selling in the below mentioned pattern  
  Day 1-One Vehicle  
  Day 2 Three Vehicles  
  Day 3-Seven Vehicles  
  Day 4-Thirteen Vehicles  
  Day 5-Twenty One Vehicles  
  Day 6.  
  Essentially this means 2 extra vehicles each day as the month progresses to what was sold in the previous day For the first 4 days       vehicles 
  are sold to the retail market. Every 5th day all vehicles sold are exclusively to corporate customers only and not in the retail market. 
  Again 4 days Super Wheels focusses on Retail Market 5th Day to Corporates and this pattern continues from beginning of the month to end of the month
